# This log-reading tool will make GMing so much easier.

Keeping track of people's movements live during session has always been kind of a pain - you have to rely on a tiny OOC window and constantly use `/getareas` to get where people are, and visually speaking it's really hard to process what's even going on.

That's where the LogReader comes in - this tool can connect to your log file, listen for any changes that happen, and move character icons around a map of your design, giving you clear, concise visual feedback to everyone's movements - at all times. It even works for post-session logs, too!
